Subclass and Super classes should be a substitute to each other.
This can either be achieved using Interface or Abstract class.
Pick the most common functionality and put it in either the abstract class or interface.

Every class that extends that abstract class or implements that interface will then become a substitute to
every other class that implements that same interface.
